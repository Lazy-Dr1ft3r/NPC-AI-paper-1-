ABSTRACT
--------
We aim to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) game using the Unity Game Engine and an in-built package called AR Foundation Kit, our focus will be to create a wildlife simulator. Making use of the ARCore (By Google) and ARKit (By Apple) tools, our game will blend virtual (3d modelled) animals with the player's real-life environment, our objective is to provide an immersive and captivating gameplay experience. Another key point in our project is the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically reinforcement learning, to govern the behaviours and animations of our virtual animals. We make use of the ML Agents package, ensuring that animal behaviours are realistic, enhancing the experience of the users. Our coding environment will be Visual Studio using the C# programming language, taking full advantage of the pre-integrated environment in Visual Studio for Unity. Our project addresses the lack of hit/successful AR games on smartphone platforms, recognizing the vast potential for innovation in this field. Our app will offer support for Android 7.0 (Nougat) and iOS 11.0 or later versions, the gameplay will feature one animal: Penguins. Future updates will introduce more animals, further enriching the player experience and expanding the possibilities within the game.
